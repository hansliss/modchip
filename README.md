# modchip
This a PCB design and ASM code for a Playstation modchip based on the tiny AVR AT90S1200.

Apart from the SSOP-20 chip, it uses two MicroMatch connectors (6-pin and 8-pin straight male through-hole mount), a Murata resonator, a LED, a capacitor and a pushbutton.

Note that everything except the MicroMatch connectors are mounted on the *rear* side!

The code wasn't properly version-tracked when I did this, so there are several different ASM files, of different age and for different uses. Figure it out!
